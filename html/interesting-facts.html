                <b>Keanu Reeves Hid a Spinal Injury to Get Through the Training Program</b> <br> <br>
                While getting paid big money to read lines on a film set sounds like a dream, the fact is actors often have to <u>invest</u> <b>copious</b> amounts of time to their roles. To master the physical elements necessary to portray the characters of the film, many of the cast members of <i>The Matrix</i> were required to undertake a <u>four-month-long</u> training program involving <b>martial arts lessons</b> and <b>complex wire work</b>. The program was especially grueling for <b>Keanu Reeves</b> who was <b><u>battling ongoing issues in his back and neck</u></b> which were so bad as to require <u>surgery</u>. He stayed tight-lipped about it though, keeping his injuries <b>hidden</b> to ensure he wouldn’t lose the <b>starring</b> role.

            <p> <b>The Actors Received Homework</b><br> <br>
                Another overlooked element of acting that may not appeal to most is the work necessary to understand complex story worlds and the characters they play who inhabit them. <b>Keanu Reeves</b> was assigned an allotment of required <b>reading, including philosophical textbooks</b> which question the mechanisms of modern society.
                Coming from <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/videos/24323-keanu-reeves-required-reading-for-the-matrix"><b>Goodreads</b></a>, three <b>essential</b> books which made up <b>Reeves’</b> homework were <b><i>Simulacra and Simulation</i></b> by Jean Baudrillard, <b><i>Out of Control</i></b> by Kevin Kelly, and <b><i>Introducing Evolutionary Psychology</i></b> by <b>Dylan Evans.</b></p>
            <p> <b>Each Cast Member’s Sunglasses Were Custom Made</b> <br> <br> 
                In addition to its <b>mind-bending</b> concept, <b>brilliant</b> action sequences, and <b>mesmerizing</b> sense of style, something <i>The Matrix</i> films became known for was their unique fashion sense. The sunglasses alone were enough to define the movies’ <i><b>badass</b></i> aura of contemporary, cyberpunk cool.
                According to <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/the-matrix-sunglasses-were-uniquely-made-for-each-cast-member.html/"><b>Showbiz CheatSheet</b></a>, the glasses were actually <b>specially</b> designed by <b>Richard Walker</b> from a company called <b>Blinde Design Project</b>, who custom-made the <b>slick</b> shades for all the main leads. The company then sold a line of sunglasses based on the designs for <i>The Matrix</i> in the wake of the <b>film’s</b> success.</p>
