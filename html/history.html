                <i>The Matrix</i> is an example of the cyberpunk subgenre of science fiction. The Wachowskis' approach to action scenes was influenced by anime and martial arts films (particularly fight choreographers and wire fu techniques from Hong Kong action cinema). Other influences include Plato's cave and 1990s Telnet hacker communities. The film popularized terms such as the <b><i>red pill</i></b>, and introduced a visual effect known as <q>bullet time</q>, in which the heightened perception of certain characters is represented by allowing the action within a shot to progress in slow motion, while the camera appears to move through the scene at normal speed, allowing the <b><i>sped-up</i></b> movements of certain characters to be perceived <b><i>normally</i></b>.

            <p> <b>Keanu Reeves as Neo:</b><br> <br>
                <b>Keanu Reeves</b> stars as <u>Neo</u>, a computer programmer and hacker who senses something is wrong with his world. Despite strong contenders like <b>Will Smith, Leonardo DiCaprio</b>, and <b>Johnny Depp</b>, <u>Reeves</u> won the role, becoming <b><i>iconic</i></b> for his portrayal of Neo's quest for truth and liberation from <i>The Matrix</i>. <br> <br> 
                <b>Laurence Fishburne as Morpheus:</b> <br> <br>
                <b>Laurence Fishburne</b> plays <u>Morpheus</u>, the wise and powerful captain of the <b><i>Nebuchadnezzar</i></b>, who believes in <b>Neo's potential</b>. Guided by the <b>Wachowskis</b> to channel the essence of the character from <b>Neil Gaiman's <q>Sandman</q></b> comics, <b>Fishburne's</b> performance remains memorable. Actors like <b>Gary Oldman</b>  and <b>Samuel L. Jackson</b> were also considered for this <u>pivotal</u> role. <br> <br>
                <b>Carrie-Anne Moss as Trinity:</b> <br> <br>
                <b>Carrie-Anne Moss</b> is <u>Trinity</u>, a skilled member of <b><i>Morpheus's crew</i></b> and <b><i>Neo's</i></b> love interest. After rigorous physical testing and initial skepticism about the film's ambitious nature, <b>Moss</b> embraced the role. <b>Janet Jackson</b> and <b>Sandra Bullock</b>  were among those who turned down the part before <b>Moss</b> was cast, marking a <u><i>turning</i></u> point in her career.</p>
